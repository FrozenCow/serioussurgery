<p>Story:</p>
<p>You are a hard-working heart surgeon. You specialize in heart transplants and are known for your professionalism in this area.</p>
<p>The hospitals where you work at aren't too great with their layouts. Operating tables are scattered in the buildings. Now you need to not only transplant hearts, but also find the patients!</p>
<p>Anyway, have fun with this silly game.</p>
